abstract: "Wine is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world with significant cultural influence. In this paper, the physicochemical properties of wine will be compared with the perceived quality of wine by wine experts. Even though the preference for wine taste is highly subjective, this study may help identify objective components for wine preference. We found that higher alcohol percentage, higher sulphate, and less acidic wines yield higher quality scores, while sugar percentage does not appear to affect scores significantly."

This repository contains all the resources and code for a paper investigating the physicochemical properties of wine and quality scores. This paper will tell be telling a story using data analysis and statistical models. This repository is organised as follows:

The inputs folder will contain the cleaned and raw datasets used for the analysis.

The outputs/paper folder will contain the .rmd file and the corresponding .pdf it generates. This folder will also contain a .bib file that contains the references used for the paper.

The scripts folder will contain the script used to download and clean the dataset.
